        Premier League club Chelsea. With a capacity of 40,343, it is the ninth largest venue of the 2023-24 Premier League season 
        and the eleventh largest football stadium in England.<br><br> Opened in 1877, the stadium was used by the London Athletic 
        Club until 1905, when new owner Gus Mears founded Chelsea Football Club to occupy the ground; Chelsea have played their 
        home games there ever since. It has undergone major changes over the years, most recently in the 1990s when it was renovated 
        into a modern, all-seater stadium.<br><br> Stamford Bridge has hosted Charity Shield games. It has also hosted numerous 
        other sports, such as cricket, rugby union, rugby league, speedway, greyhound racing, baseball and American football.
