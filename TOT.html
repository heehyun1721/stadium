    <img src="https://cdne-totv8-prod-westeurope.azureedge.net/media/29247/header-image-resized.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>The home of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and the largest club stadium in London with a capacity of 62,850.<br><br>
        Opened in April, 2019, the stadium is designed to maximise the supporter experience and brings fans closer to the pitch 
        than at any comparable size stadium in the UK - distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres 
        to 7.9 metres.<br><br> Our 17,500-seat, single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK and stands at more than 34 metres 
        in height - on top of which sits the Club's famous golden cockerel.<br><br> Over 60 food and drink outlets across the stadium 
        are inspired by London's vibrant street food scene, offering supporters a wide range of choice, including plant-based options 
        throughout. Highlights include The Market Place in the South Stand, featuring Europe's longest bar - The Goal Line.<br><br>
        The stadium is multi-use with a unique, dividing retractable grass surface enabling the staging of a variety of major events
        in addition to Spurs matches, including NFL, boxing, rugby and concerts - creating recurring sources of revenue for the Club 
        to reinvest in its football activities.<br><br> With the addition of Visitor Attractions, including Stadium Tours and 
        The Dare Skywalk, and world-class Conference & Events facilities, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium brings nearly two million visitors 
        to N17 every year and a Â£344m annual boost to the local economy in one of London's most deprived areas.<br><br>Tottenham Hotspur
        is Premier League's greenest club and the stadium is powered by 100% renewable energy, with a zero waste-to-landfill policy, 
        a reusable beer cup scheme and a wide range of public transport options.</p>
