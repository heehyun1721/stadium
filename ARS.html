    <p>The Emirates Stadium (known as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England. 
        It has been the home stadium of Arsenal Football Club since its completion in 2006. It has a current seated capacity of 
        60,704, making it the fifth-largest football stadium in England by capacity.<br><br> In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of 
        relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home stadium, 
        Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste 
        disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the 
        site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the "biggest decision in Arsenal's history" since the board appointed Herbert 
        Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until 2004. Emirates was later announced as the 
        main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million. The club's former 
        stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.<br><br> The stadium has undergone a process of "Arsenalisation" 
        since 2009 with the aim of restoring visible links to Arsenal's history. The stadium has hosted international fixtures and 
        music concerts.</p>
