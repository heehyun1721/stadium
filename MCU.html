    <p>Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United. 
        With a capacity of 74,310 it is the largest club football stadium (and second-largest football stadium overall after 
        Wembley Stadium) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford
        Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop.<br><br> Nicknamed "The Theatre of Dreams" by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been 
        United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City 
        as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including 
        the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 
        80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the 
        capacity to around 88,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup 
        semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.<br><br> Old Trafford has hosted an FA Cup Final, two final 
        replays and was regularly used as a neutral venue for the competition's semi-finals. It has also hosted England fixtures, 
        matches at the 1966 World Cup, Euro 96 and the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women's international football for the first 
        time in its history, and the 2003 Champions League Final. Outside football, it has been the venue for rugby league's annual
        Super League Grand Final every year except 2020, and the final of Rugby League World Cups in 2000, 2013 and 2022.</p>
