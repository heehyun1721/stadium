    <p>The City of Manchester Stadium (currently known as the Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons), 
        is the home of Premier League club Manchester City, with a domestic football capacity of 55,000, 
        making it the 6th-largest football stadium in England and ninth-largest in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
        Built to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the stadium has since staged the 2008 UEFA Cup final, 
        England football internationals, rugby league matches, a boxing world title fight, 
        the England rugby union team's final group match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup and summer music concerts 
        during the football off-season.<br><br>
        The stadium, originally proposed as an athletics arena in Manchester's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics,
        was converted after the 2002 Commonwealth Games from a 38,000 capacity arena to a 48,000 seat football stadium 
        at a cost to the city council of £22 million and to Manchester City of £20 million. Manchester City F.C. agreed 
        to lease the stadium from Manchester City Council and moved there from Maine Road in the summer of 2003.<br><br>
        The stadium was built by Laing Construction at a cost of £112 million and was designed and engineered by 
        Arup, whose design incorporated a cable-stayed roof structure and supported entirely by twelve exterior masts 
        and cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal 
        Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design and a special award in 
        2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design.<br><br>
        In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015-16 
        football season. The expansion was designed to be in keeping with the existing roof design. A £300 million 
        redevelopment programme of the existing North Stand entailing the construction of a new hotel with 400 rooms, 
        covered fan park for 6,000 people and increased net capacity to 61,474 is expected to commence in 2023 and be 
        completed by the end of 2026.</p>
