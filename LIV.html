    <p>Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, Merseyside, England, which has a seating capacity of 53,394, making it 
        the seventh largest football stadium in England. It has been the home of Liverpool since their formation in 1892. It was 
        originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.<br><br>
        The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record 
        attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an 
        all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.<br><br> Two gates at the stadium are named 
        after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the 
        stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) 
        from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.<br><br> It was proposed in 2002 for the club to relocate to a new stadium in the 
        adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this 
        would not happen, with the decision being taken to expand Anfield instead. Construction for an extension to the main stand 
        began on 8 December 2014. This extension, one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football, opened to the 
        public on 9 September 2016, increasing the stadium capacity to 53,394. The Anfield Road Stand is currently being redeveloped 
        to bring the stadium capacity to around 61,000. It is due to be completed in time for the 2023-24 season.</p>
